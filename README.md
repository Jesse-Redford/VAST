# VAST - Valid Action State Transition Optimization

The idea of VAST is to provide all the resources you need to ML and RL running on your robotic projects. Each master folder contains a robot prototype. These folder contain setup intrucstions, wiring details, code examples, results and more.


# Nerual Network Visualization






# Snakebot - Master

- add folder with all Qlearning and DQN files and documentation once verified and completed, highlight plots, images and video results here

# Fishbot - Master

- add folder with all Qlearning and DQN files and documentation once verified and completed, highlight plots, images and video results here

# Intellegent Locomotion Controller - Master

- add folder containing all files and documentation for developing an Intellegent Locomotion Controller which uses 
- Qlearning to devleop low level control polcies which are then saved and used by a highlevel DQN network as actions
- in order to naviage to difference global coordinates highlight plots, images and video results here


# VAST App - Master

- add kivy documetation and files for creating a monioritng and deployment app

# ROS Developer Guide
- code details and setup for using ROS and online development studio
